# Productivity App - React Js

<img src="https://github.com/nldanne/productivity-app/blob/master/docs/todo-app-thumbnail.jpg" alt="mockup of productivity app" width="900">

A task management application that helps you stay organized and focused to make you get things done.
The app was built with React Js, custom CSS, React Icons and utilizing React Hooks for state management.

The goal of this project was to practice CRUD operations while learning more about React Js, and I needed a simple application to track my todos.

## Key Learning Objectives
* [**useEffect:**](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useeffect) to learn other scenarios where useEffect is helpful other than an api call
* [**useState:**](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate) to deepen my understanding of passing props between components
* [**React Icons:**](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) to use popular icons with the ease of an icon library
* **Responsive Design and UI/UX Design:** to practice my UI development skills combined with optimized usability


## Status of the project
Currently, the web app can be used to create new tasks, filter them based on completion, and deleting them one by one or all at once.
There are other functionalities that could be added, such as editing the text of existing tasks, adding a deadline to each of them, or even creating a pomodoro clock for better productivity. However, I'm pleased with the state of this project and will continue on other ones to learn more about frontend development, design, and technology in general.
